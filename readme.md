#Altruict
This project was started in Lehman's 2016 Hackathon by [Josue](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas), Jose, Maria, Edgar, and Safa.


Our main focus was not UI but rather the idea of how to make it easier for people in need to get help and those who want to help, make it easier to do so. We focused on donations of goods rather than monetary giving simply because it is safer, straight to the point, and in this way we know they are getting what the person needs rather than wondering. 

Our app is made with simplicty in mind (although aesthetics should be worked on) from opening the app the top button is the "+ Make Post" where a user can create a new post for someone or themselves to ask for items they need. Followed by this are post already made from othe people.

By clicking on "+ Make Post" you can write your name, items needed, and a description of why you need them or simply a backstory.

After clicking submit you will get to preview the post and finally hit submit if you are satisfied with it.
